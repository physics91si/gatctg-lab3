Part1:
    - Overall good style. You broke down the problem to make it easier to solve, which in my opinion is the right way to tackle different problems.
    - I like the fact that you seem to have tested it with different parameters,
    
Part2:
    - Great use of numpy even before we explain what numpy is!
    
Part3:
    - Really good print statements. They look very clean and readable.
